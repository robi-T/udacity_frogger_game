## Instructions

This is a simple/basic implementation of the Classic Arcade Game Frogger.

1.) To start the game, simply press ENTER on your keyboard.

2.) Gameplay is straightforward - to move your character press: left, right, up or down arrow. The goal of the game is to reach water 5 times. Each time the water is
reached, the player earns 100 points. When the player collects 500 points (reaches the water for the 5th time) the game is won. On his journey to water, the player has to avoid evil bugs. Every time a player collides with a bug, it loses one life. After all three lives are lost the game ends. Luckily, the player character is resurrected after that and the player can start over.


## Implementation

The following files have been changed:
index.html
css/style.css
js/app.js
js/engine.js (minor but relevant fixes and small updates)

The application logic is implemented in js/app.js file and since it is well documented the reader is directed to the source file for more details.
